### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I used the css flexbox tool, enabling me to optimize responsiveness. I started with a desktop first view, although I eventually went around to styling each simultaneously on two different browsers. I still prefer mobile-first designs. ðŸ¤£
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

I really learnt to be careful with my widths, margins and paddings! I got to really see them in play today. Also learnt to be really thorough in foloowing a design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<sup class="span2">
    $169.99
</sup>
```
```css
.span2 {
    text-decoration: line-through;
    text-decoration-color: grey;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, I'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Going to do a lotmore studying on my CSS. I guess, you never  really fully master CSS and, at that, you have to check and recheck a lot of times. That is definately something I am going to do, especially with all the seemingly "less important" properties.
